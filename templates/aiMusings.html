        <h2 class="nospace">The Landscape</h2>
        <p class="nospace">Complex, nuanced, multidimensional, and rapidly changing.  Re-injected into the zeitgist by OpenAI's chatGPT.  Powered by the concept of the large language model (LLM), the transformer, and a steadfast commitment of AI researchers to push the field of AI forward since it's birth in 1956.  The ongoing debate on how to best respond to these new breakthroughs could be defined as a continuum between the points that Mark Andreesson's <a href="https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world" target="_blank">AI Will Save the World</a> and Tristan Harris's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ" target="_blank">The AI Dilemma</a> are attempting to make.  My hope in chronicling my learning journey in this form is to create a space where you can learn, explore, and form your own opinon on the topic.  I believe the stakes are high and am comitted to actively engaging, learning, and participating instead of surrendering as a bystander.  I am far from an expert so please reach out if something I've shared here is innacurate, dated, or misleading.<p>
